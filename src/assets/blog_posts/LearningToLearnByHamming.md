## Intro

- Why I decided to read it
- background on Hamming and when the book was written and in what context
- luck favors the prepared mind

## The client's problem isn't the problem you're trying to solve

- How would I do this vs how would a computer do this?
- The medium in which you solve a problen inherently changes the problem
- If I had a solution, what would it look like?

## Good engineers follow the requirements, but great engineers plan on the requirements changing

- Engineers change the problem for a more elegant solution
- the closer you meet specifications, the worse the performance will be when overloaded
- Requirement creep

## Data is inherently unreliable

- What are you measuring?
- How is this data useful to me and what are the pitfalls?

## Keep the system at the forefront of your mind

- local optimization vs global optimization
- small changes lead to big side effects

## Learning has compound growth

- Be innovation-adjacent
- Tutorial hell
- Knowledge hooks

## Wrap up
